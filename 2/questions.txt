-Which image (object_02_1.png or object_03_1.png) is more similar
to image object_01_1.png considering the L2 distance? How about the other three
distances? We can see that all three histograms contain a strongly expressed component (one bin has a much higher value than the others). Which color does this
bin represent?

->object 3 is more similar to object 1 considering the L2 distance (and all other distances)
The bin represents the color black


-Which distance is in your opinion best suited for image retrieval? How
does the retrieved sequence change if you use a different number of bins? Is the
execution time affected by the number of bins?

->with different number of bins you get less precise distances
if we have more bins the execution time goes up


-Can you recognize the shape of the kernel? What is the sum of the
elements in the kernel? How does the kernel affect the signal?

->The kernel is a gaussian (because it's the same as ours), the sum of the elements is very close to 1. It removes high frequency signals "smooths the singals".


The figure below shows two kernels (a) and (b) as well as signal (c).
Sketch (do not focus on exact proportions of your drawing but rather on the understanding of what you are doing) the resulting convolved signal of the given input
signal and each kernel.



-Which noise is better removed using the Gaussian filter?

-> Gaussian noise


-Which filter performs better at this specific task (removing salt & pepper noise)? In comparison to
Gaussian filter that can be applied multiple times in any order, does the order
matter in case of median filter? What is the name of filters like this ?

-> The median filter is better suited for this task, because it's not affected by outliers.
   Median filter in a non-linear filter (the output is not a linear function of it's input), that is why the order matters (still not 100% why).


-What is the computational complexity of the Gaussian filter operation?
How about the median filter? What does it depend on? Describe the computational
complexity using the O(·) notation (you can assume n log n complexity for sorting).

-> n = width and height of the image, w is the witdh and height of the kernel
Gaussian : O(n^2 * w^2) for 2d convolution and O(2*n^2*w) = O(n^2*w) for two 1d convolutions
Median : O(n^2 * w^2logw^2) for median filter
